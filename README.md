The attached LATEX and pdf files show the rise of liquid in a capillary tube in the presence of the gas phase. In this schematic, the pressure of the gas phase is fixed; the pressure of the confined liquid in the capillary tube changes according to the curvature and contact angle.

You may want to modify the LATEX file for alternative conditions (such as different wettability, or constraints).

Any improvement to the code is appreciated.

Hope it is useful for you.
